  Read-DesignState.ps1 never exits the process - it has no exit-code contract, unlike
  Wait-PullRequestCheck.ps1 or Test-DesignDrift.ps1 - so these tests dot-source it purely to
  reuse its functions and skip its own invocation block, the same guard shape those two scripts
  already use.

  Every fixture below is written into $TestDrive as design/state/... under a throwaway root;
  none of these tests (other than the S4.6 closure checks, which are explicit about reading the
  real one) read the containing checkout's own design/state/. That S4.6 block asserts on adopted
  design-state content, which only this repository has: the 2026-08-19 compatibility promise
  (design/90-decisions.md) leaves the installed targets unmigrated, and this file is copied into
  every one of them. So it is skipped wherever design/state/units/ is absent - false and unevaluated
  rather than a false pass or a false failure, the same way Test-DesignState.ps1 itself reports
  StateSetAbsent and exits 2 rather than a silent 0.
