.SYNOPSIS
    Reports what a Claude Code session actually cost, from the transcript.

.DESCRIPTION
    Claude Code writes one JSONL transcript per session under
    ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/, with real per-call usage on every assistant
    record. This reads those files. It measures; it does not estimate, and it
    asks the model for nothing.

    Input is reported as four separate numbers because they are priced
    differently and behave differently. Collapsing them into one "tokens in"
    hides the only figure that usually matters: cache_read, which grows with
    conversation length and dominates every long session measured so far.

    No prices. Rates change, and a rate written from memory is exactly the
    fabricated number this script exists to replace. Multiply the columns by
    current published rates yourself.

    Claude Code only, and it says so rather than guessing. Every transcript is
    shape-checked before it is summed, and anything else is a hard error: a
    foreign transcript parsed for 'message.usage' yields zero, and a zero is
    indistinguishable from a session that cost nothing.

    The other two agents in this repository's routing table:

      Codex     Stores ~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl and records
                usage as 'token_count' events under payload.info. Readable in
                principle, unimplemented here, and its counts are per turn
                rather than per call.
      Copilot   Stores globalStorage/github.copilot-chat/session-store.db, whose
                'turns' table has no usage column. Copilot meters premium
                requests, not tokens. Nothing to read, at any effort.

.PARAMETER Project
    Repository root to report on. Defaults to the current directory.

.PARAMETER TranscriptPath
    Read transcripts from this directory instead of deriving one from -Project.
    For an exported or relocated store, and for testing against a fixture.

.PARAMETER SessionId
    Report one session. Accepts a full id or a unique prefix. Default: all.

.PARAMETER Detail
    Break each session down by slash-command segment.

.PARAMETER Human
    Print the aligned text table instead of JSON. Default output is JSON so
    the report can be piped into other tools without a parser written against
    a table meant for a terminal; pass -Human for the table a person reads.

.PARAMETER Hook
    Run as a SessionEnd hook. Reads the hook's JSON from stdin, measures the
    session it names, and writes one row to .claude/session-costs.tsv beside
    this script's repository. Prints nothing by choice rather than by
    limitation: SessionEnd stdout is shown to the user on exit 0, but a total
    arriving as the session closes is a number nobody can act on. The log is
    the deliverable because it accumulates a trend.

    Idempotent. SessionEnd also fires on clear and resume, so a session can be
    reported more than once; an existing row for the same id is replaced rather
    than duplicated.

    The log is a convenience, not the record. Transcripts are durable, so a
    session killed before the hook fires is recovered by re-running this script
    without -Hook.

.PARAMETER Watch
    Run as a UserPromptSubmit hook. Reports the session's current context size
    once it crosses -WarnAtTokens, and stays silent below it.

    UserPromptSubmit is the event that fits: it fires before the turn is
    processed, so the warning arrives while the session can still be ended
    rather than after the expensive turn, and its stdout is injected as context
    so the model reads it too. It always exits 0. Exit 2 on this event blocks
    the prompt and erases what the user typed, which is never worth a cost
    warning.

    Silence below the threshold is the design, not an optimisation. An
    unconditional per-turn metrics block was rejected on 2026-08-04 for
    injecting noise on every turn while claiming to save tokens; a gated
    warning is a different proposal rather than that one again.

.PARAMETER WarnAtTokens
    Context size that triggers the advisory warning. Default 150000, measured:
    it is where sessions in this repository began climbing towards the 300-450K
    per call that the largest ones sustained. Twice this value reads as a
    firmer warning.

.PARAMETER IdleThresholdMinutes
    Gaps longer than this are treated as idle and excluded from active time.
    Default 5.

      checkout - so a session run there wrote its row to

      the main checkout's log, and lost outright once the worktree is
      deleted (this repository's own /clean does exactly that after a

      .git directory regardless of which worktree asks, so its parent is
      the one stable place every checkout of this repository agrees on.

      Falls back to the pre-fix path (beside the running script) when git
      is unavailable or the tree is not a git repository at all - the
